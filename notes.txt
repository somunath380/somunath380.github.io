there are 3 elements of css
1. block-element (takes entire line, ex: p element)
2. inline-block element (take as much space as they needs, ex: img, input)
3. inline element ()

1. put everything inside a div
2. set the width of the div to a number
so all things inside the div will be having the same width
3. by default div is a block element, so change it to inline-block
so we can put another div on the right side of this div


css grids

we can use css grid display inplace of inline-block
to do this we need 2 css property

1. display: grid

2. grid-template-columns this takes n number of values
and the number of values decide how many columns will be there

for ex:
    if grid-template-columns: 100px 100px 100px then there will be 3 columns each having 100px of width

there is 1 special value i.e 1fr which means the width will be the remaining free space

so if 
    grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr then 1 col will be 100px and another col will take the remaining free space

    if grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 2fr then 1 col will be 100px and another 2 cols will take the remaining free space 1 with 1/3 space and another with 2/3 of the free space



css flexbox
we can use flexbox as a replacement to grids
it also works as grid

1. display: flex
2. flex-direction: row; as this will create a horizontal rows
3. give the param flex: 1 or flex: 2 this acts as 1fr in grid-template-columns value
4. justify-content: center/start/end/space-between (this will put the content in the box accordingly)
5. align-items: stretch/start/end/center (this will allign contents in the box vertically in each boxes)
6. max-width: 300px (it means the width can be max 300px and after that it will not increase)


the difference between grid and flex is that layout
grid = grid layout
flex = flexible layout

css position:
this is used to keed the things as where they are while scrolling
and when we hover over the buttons it can show description about the buttons

the css property is position
it has default value static but it can have other values like

fixed, absolute, relative etc

use position: fixed to fix the position of the container
but if the position is default which is background will stretch to the end of the right side
if position: fixed the background will behave as inline-block

4 properties can be used to move the fixed element
1. top: move the element from the top
2. left: move the element from the left
3. right and bottom
but if we set opposite directions i.e right: 10px and left: 10px, the background will stretch all the way
to meet the requirements
